Seven languages in seven weeks
==============================

These are my exercises for the book ["seven languages in seven weeks"][1]. I boght the book some time ago and read several chapters, but until now I had no time to do the exercises. 

1. Ruby: I use Ruby since several years, but I will do the exercises anyway.
